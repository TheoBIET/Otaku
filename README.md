# 🇫🇷 🇯🇵 otaku-API &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

o'taku is an API that allows you to find functional streaming links for your favorite anime. This project aims to simplify the tracking of a particular anime. Indeed, when you search for an anime, you will receive a lot of information about it (all the information comes from a database provided and updated every day which is fed by the MyAnimeList API, I made this choice to decrease the response time) but also, a list of streaming links available in several languages. No more evenings looking for a working streaming link before binge-watching your favourite series!

-   This project is currently **under development.** 🏗️
